# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: implement
- **Task**: Phase 0 (monorepo readiness for multi-platform)
- **Status**: done

## Original goal

Implement full sop.txt briefcase (extension, mobile signer, hardware keys, remote MCP routing, real x402/L402, revocation, AI policy compiler, enterprise control plane)

## Completed

- Research + constraints + gaps captured (`research.md`)
- Full requirements and acceptance criteria captured (`requirements.md`)
- Target architecture and contracts captured (`design.md`)
- End-to-end work breakdown captured (`tasks.md`)
- Phase 0: `justfile` + Node workspace + OpenAPI + generated TS types + CI updated

## Learnings

- This is a multi-platform effort; treat each major area as its own sub-spec/epic with its own CI gates.
- Keep enforcement centralized in `briefcased`; all new surfaces must remain non-secret-bearing.

## Blockers

- None (planning phase complete). Implementation is large and should be sequenced by Phases 0-12 in `tasks.md`.

## Next steps

1. Phase 1.1: implement `crates/briefcase-mcp` (protocol + transports) with conformance tests.
2. Phase 1.2: upgrade `apps/mcp-gateway` to use `briefcase-mcp` server implementation.
