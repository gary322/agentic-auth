# Progress

## Current

- **Phase**: implement
- **Task**: Phase 5 hardening (multi-provider, PoP, payments interface, risk scoring, packaging)
- **Status**: done (v0.1)

## Original goal

Ship v1 credential briefcase per sop.txt (secrets, OAuth, VC, payments rails, UI)

## Completed

- Secret store backends (keyring/file/memory) + integration into daemon
- Holder DID generation (`did:key` Ed25519)
- OAuth (PKCE loopback) + VC entitlement flow (demo)
- Provider-side reference gateway supporting OAuth/VC/payments and capability issuance
- UI proxy for approvals/receipts/provider status
- Receipts verification endpoint + CLI support
- Provider registry + multi-provider support (per-provider OAuth/VC)
- Capability PoP binding + replay defense (provider gateway + briefcased client)
- Payment rails extracted behind `briefcase-payments` (demo HTTP + command helper backend)
- Non-authoritative risk scoring (heuristics + optional HTTP classifier) that can require approval
- Packaging templates + release workflow (checksums + keyless signing)

## Learnings

- Keep secrets strictly in the daemon boundary; CLI/UI are trusted admin surfaces only.
- Prefer explicit, deterministic policy enforcement (Cedar) and treat LLM translations as non-authoritative.
- Keep protocols demo-able but modular so real rails can replace demo stubs.

## Blockers

- None for v1 reference implementation.

## Next steps

1. Harden isolation further (OS-level sandboxing, stricter per-tool egress allowlists).
2. Add remote MCP routing (gateway as MCP client) and connector sandboxing.
